**MAIN STUDY** <br />
This dataset consists of 40 healthy, right-handed participants (sub-p019 to sub-p068) (see participants.tsv file) + 7 discarded participants. <br />
* sub-p022: incomplete behavioral data (MEM), participant skipped nearly all keywords  <br />
* sub-p024: no signal drop in DSC data detected, venous line probably too short / blocked! No CBV data <br />
* sub-p025: no signal drop in DSC data detected, venous line probably too short / blocked! No CBV data <br />
* sub-p042: CBF maps are one-sided /unilateral <br />
* sub-p053: unilateral data in T2* calc  <br />
* sub-p056: movement artifacts/ringing, unilateral data in T2* calc <br />
* sub-p062: huge susceptibility artifacts above ear canals, did therefore not acquire contrast-agent CBV data <br />
(sub-p041, sub-p045, sub-p057 did not show up /cancelled short-notice. These participants were skipped completely without any data acquisition done.) <br />
<br />


**REPLICATION STUDY**  <br />
